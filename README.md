# Tipping Assistant Calculator

This is a simple Python program that helps you calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including the tip.

## How It Works

The program prompts the user to input:
1. The total bill amount.
2. The desired tip amount (in dollars).
3. The number of people splitting the bill.

It then calculates:
- The total amount including the tip.
- The amount each person needs to pay when splitting the bill evenly.

### Example Usage
